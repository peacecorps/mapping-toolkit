##Introduction

Since digital mapping trainings successfully debuted at the Stomp Out Malaria Boot Camp, Peace Corps Volunteers and posts around the globe have worked to help their host communities put themselves “on the map” via OpenStreetMap (OSM). Geospatial data provides rigor to projects in every sector by enabling PCVs and counterparts to make data-driven decisions and visualize project info. PCVs who help their communities put themselves on OSM leave behind an incredibly useful, tangible resource and empower their communities to allocate resources more effectively, track the effects of climate change, participate in epidemiology, promote local businesses and more. Digital maps are also crucial for resilience building, and OSM is the map of choice for humanitarian responders in case of natural disaster. Peace Corps’ key role in international digital mapping efforts have been featured at the White House and presented at the United Nations.

##Principles 

Peace Corps Volunteers, staff and counterparts who use OpenStreetMap and other geospatial data in their work are encouraged to do so with the following principles in mind (with many thanks to the fantastic Peace Corps [T4D Playbook] (https://github.com/PeaceCorps/t4d-playbook) :

####1. Listen to the community
Volunteers put in the time, the energy, and the importance of becoming a part of their communities and understanding them to the best of their abilities. Think of your communities first, and on the impact that your efforts will have on the lives of those around them. Focus on enabling environments and empowerment for those closest to the problem.

####2. Design for scale and sustainability
Volunteers look to have global impact through community-level actions -- and not simply in the near-term. The changes in communication and technologies allow Volunteers to share experiences, resources, and models for replicating, scaling, and transforming their efforts across our global reach.

####3. Focus on needs and challenges, not on technologies
Focus on solving local problems that are debated, defined and refined by local people in an ongoing process. Foster real results – real solutions to real problems that have real impact: they build trust, empower people and promote sustainability.

####4. Co-create and build with buy-in
Legitimize at all levels (political, managerial and social), building ownership and momentum throughout the process to be ‘locally owned’ in reality (not just on paper). Volunteers are by nature and training inclusive. They bring anyone and everyone to the table—the ones with strong voices as well as those who have not traditionally had a voice at the table. Peace Corps knows that we can go further, together. 

####5. Tinker, make, do
Volunteers are tinkerers, makers, and hackers. Volunteers do more with less. They help their communities to start where they are, use what they have, and do what they can—starting the day they arrive.

####6. Open data

Data that can be open and accessible should be open and accessible. In other words, if you collect geospatial data that would be of genuine interest to the public, such as points of interest or alternate names of villages, you should include it in OpenStreetMap so that others may benefit from your work. Data should be stored in machine-readable formats such as spreadsheets or CSV files, rather than PDFs, when possible. For an introduction to open data, read the Open Knowledge Foundation's [Open Data Handbook.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Vr8VHoYeB7U2NTczFYRE01RU0/view)

####7. Humans > data, always

Volunteers think first of their communities, and look to help them in ways that protect the privacy, safety, and security of everyone they engage with. Some data that Peace Corps Volunteers and their colleagues collect and use -- for example, in public health projects -- could contain personal and sensitive information about humans that needs to be well-protected and secured. For solid tips on data responsibility, read ["Shooting our hard drive into space and other ways to practice responsible development data".](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Vr8VHoYeB7cEk1STFlRTJjOWM/edit) 

####8. Diversity and inclusivity

Data collection and OpenStreetMap activities should intentionally promote diversity and inclusivity. Peace Corps Volunteers and counterparts should include minority populations, such as women, in their data collection and OpenStreetMap projects. Data collection tends to incorporate implicit biases, especially regarding women and groups that don't identify with binary genders. For more information, read TechChange's ["The Case for Gender Data".](https://www.techchange.org/2015/04/17/global-development-gender-data/)

####9. Human Centered Design

Human Centered Design emphasizes empathy, optimism, learning from failure and rapid iteration -- the hallmarks of any great Peace Corps project. Blend design and implementation through rapid cycles of planning, action, reflection and revision (drawing on local knowledge, feedback and energy) to foster learning from both success and failure. Manage risks by making ‘small bets’: pursuing activities with promise and dropping others. To learn more about how to use Human Centered Design in your Peace Corps work (highly recommended!), see IDEO's [Design Kit and Field Guide to Human Centered Design.](http://www.designkit.org/)

##Peace Corps OpenStreetMap Projects in a Box

[Peace Corps OSM "Projects in Box"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxqYHzBUSr1NfnBlV2dnMVNhNmlCcC1zcnFqV204VVEzdXNvQmpNamkwMmhqZ0U3U214SWc&authuser=0) were written specifically for PCVs in the field and counterparts to put their communities on OSM in innovative ways. This content includes a Community Mapping Training Guide (in the Points of Interest doc) and guides to throwing mapping parties, adding local points of interest to OSM, bike and map tours, OSM map murals and more.  

Projects in a Box include:

1. One Day Project: Mapping Party

2. One Week Project: Community Mapping Training and Mapping Points of Interest

3. One Week Project: Bike and Map Tour

4. One Month Project: OpenStreetMap Wall Mural

##Peace Corps Mapping Trainings

While any good Peace Corps trainer will always customize resources and knowledge to fit their local context, this template provides a great starting point for Peace Corps Volunteers, staff and counterparts to present an introduction to mapmaking. The "Intro to Mapping for Peace Corps" slide deck can be found [here] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vhoaPy0jB4CuUi76ypZmjyZO6ueBjigVwF8bRM-pzlI/edit?usp=sharing). 

##For Post Staff

The Office of Innovation has identified several key opportunities to involve your post in the Peace Corps Mapping Initiative. We are happy to help facilitate any of the following activities, in addition to projects designed by your post or PCVS:

**1. Invitee trainings.** We offer an eight to ten week invitee engagement program that will train your invitees in OSM and the basics of geospatial data. The program requires about an hour of invitee time per week and includes an interactive video chat session. 

**2. Projects in a box.** We have developed a series of short, engaging toolkits that any PCV can pick up and easily implement at site. All projects in a box plus other OSM and geospatial data resources can be found in our OSM toolkit on Github at http://bit.ly/1Rpaj8B. 

**3. Virtual PCV and/or post staff trainings.** Via video chat, we offer trainings for your post staff and/or PCVs in OSM and the use of geospatial data. We’ll work with you to customize the trainings based on your sectors or post’s needs -- e.g. how to create an easy-to-edit map of your capital for your Safety and Security Manager. To date we have led virtual trainings for a range of clients, including the Mozambique’s Stomp Out Malaria committee and  Guyana’s SSM and Training Managers. 

To involve your post in any of these activities, propose a different activity, or for more information please contact Courtney Clark, Mapping Initiative Lead, at cclark2@peacecorps.gov.

##Map community building with Maptime

[Maptime](http://maptime.io/about/) is an open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge, offering intentional educational support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for mapping tutorials, workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time. Beginners most welcome!

Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?

That’s our story. Come be a part of it.

Maps for all forever! --From the Maptime website

![Maptime logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptime/maptime.github.io/master/img/xmaptime-logo-web-header-rainbonly.png.pagespeed.ic.sUvy41gYSf.png)

Anyone can start a chapter! See a list of current Maptime chapters [here](http://maptime.io/chapters/). We'd love for Peace Corps Volunteers and counterparts to experiment with starting a Maptime chapter at their site or in their nearest city. For more information about starting a chapter, email hello@maptime.io. And then let Courtney Clark know at cclark2@peacecorps.gov, because you're awesome and she'll want to brag about you.
